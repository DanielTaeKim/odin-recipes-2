        <li>1 cup fresh spinach leaves</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to the 
            package instructions until it's al dente. Drain the pasta and set it aside.</li>
        <li>In a food processor, combine the basil, spinach, parsley, minced garlic, pine nuts, 
            and grated Parmesan cheese. Pulse until the ingredients are finely chopped and well 
            blended. </li>
        <li>While the food processor is running, slowly drizzle in the extra-virgin olive oil until 
            the mixture forms a smooth, vibrant green sauce. Season the sauce with salt and black 
            pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooked pasta and the Verde sauce. Toss the pasta 
            until it's evenly coated with the delicious green sauce.</li>
        <li>Plate the Verde Pasta on individual serving dishes. Garnish with additional grated Parmesan 
            cheese and a sprinkle of pine nuts, if desired.</li>
